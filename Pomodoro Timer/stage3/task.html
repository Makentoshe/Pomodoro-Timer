<p>In this stage, you should implement some graphical features such as a indeterminate progress bar
    that helps users to understand the current application status</p>

<ol>
    <li>This progress bar should appear then the timer starts and disappear on reset.</li>

    <li>Let's make the example more complicated: the progress bar color should be changed each
        second. Color does not matter. You can set a new random color on each iteration, or just
        switch between the two.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>At the end of the stage, you should get something line in the picture below:</p>
